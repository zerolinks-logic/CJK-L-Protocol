# CJK-L-Protocol
A sovereign logic protocol for East Asian AI based on Hangul structural mapping to reduce token entropy and compute costs
# CJK-L Standard: A Sovereign Logic Protocol for East Asian AI
> **"We don't need more H100s. We need a better logic."**

## 1. Abstract / 概述
Current AI architectures are built upon an **English-centric logic**, which is inherently inefficient for East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). This "Logic Colonialism" leads to massive computational redundancy, high token consumption, and unnecessary power drainage. To compensate for this inefficiency, the industry blindly stacks hardware (NVIDIA H100s), leading to a "Compute Inflation."

**CJK-L (Logical-Hangul)** is a sovereign protocol designed to re-base East Asian semantic mapping onto the **Hangul Syllabic Block (谚文音节块)**. By treating Hangul not as a language, but as a **native 2D-bitstream algorithm**, we can compress East Asian semantics into a highly efficient, high-density logic flow.

## 2. The Core Innovation / 核心创新
### The "Logic-Hangul" Mapping
We utilize the mathematical "building-block" nature of Hangul to encode CJK semantics:
* **Semantic Skeleton:** Hanzi/Kanji (Meaning)
* **Logic Container:** Hangul Jamo Blocks (Structural Efficiency)
* **Disambiguation:** Tonal Hash (1, 2, 3, 4)

**Traditional Tokenization:** `[Meaning] -> [English-centric Mapping] -> [Fragmented Tokens] = High Entropy`

**CJK-L Protocol:** `[Meaning] -> [Hangul Block + Tonal Hash] = Low Entropy / Native Execution`

## 3. Why CJK-L? / 为什么选择 CJK-L?
* **Energy Efficiency:** Estimated **40%+ reduction** in inference power consumption.
* **Computational Sovereignty:** Breaking free from the "Token Colonialism" of Western models.
* **Native Speed:** Shorter sequence lengths mean faster response times on edge devices (Mobile, Glass, IoT).

**Standard Created & Defined by:** [zerolinks]  
**Date of First Publication:** February 23, 2026  

This repository serves as the **Prior Art (现有技术)** for the CJK-L Standard. 
1. **Intellectual Sovereignty:** The logic, mapping framework, and the "Syllabic-Digital Hash" architecture defined here are the intellectual property of the creator.
2. **Defensive Open-Source:** This standard is published to prevent any centralized entity from monopolizing this "Native East Asian Logic" through patents.
3. **Usage:** Any implementation of this protocol must credit the **CJK-L Standard** and its original creator.
